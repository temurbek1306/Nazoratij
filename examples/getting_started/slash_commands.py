"""Example demonstrating Plan Slash Command (/plan) in the SDK.

This example showcases:
- Sending the `/plan` slash command programmatically using the
  `types.SlashCommand` object in a prompt parts list.
- Understanding how planning mode generates a detailed implementation plan and
  awaits user approval (human-in-the-loop).

Criteria for correct script performance:
  1. The script exits cleanly with return code 0 (no unhandled exceptions).
  2. The agent successfully generates an implementation plan artifact.
  3. The script prints a success message confirming the plan exists.
